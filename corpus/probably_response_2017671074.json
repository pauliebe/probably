This regiment is named after the remarkable personality, who, if permitted by Karinski, could probably have prevented the downfall of the Duma and the sensational coup of the Bolsheviks in November 1917. General Korniloff pleaded with Karinski for severe measures, and was backed up by the \"division savage\", which idolized him"
