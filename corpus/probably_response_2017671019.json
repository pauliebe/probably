Nearly every bridge in Serbia suffered the same fate, and it will probably be years until they are reconstructed. The Serbians have put ferries into operation at the most important crossings and Major G.H. Edwards, of Orlando, Fla. is seen crossing on one of these. Major Edwards is the deputy Commissioner of the Serbian Commission of the American Red Cross, and has been decorated by the Serbian government for his work there"
