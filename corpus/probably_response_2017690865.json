There may be no more aluminum for coffee percolators these days; it's going instead toward a much more vital purpose--war essentials for Uncle Sam's armed forces. Destination of the finished aluminum products is secret--but they'll probably end up as jeeps or airplane engine parts. Aluminum Industries Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio"
