Nearly all the older peasant women carry their pipes and never outlook an opportunity to sit down and enjoy a good smoke. This old woman calls every few days to see her daughter who is a patient in the American Red Cross hospital in Belgrade. Always after making her visit she sits down outside the hospital and lights her pipe to think over the strange things she has seen in the American institution"
