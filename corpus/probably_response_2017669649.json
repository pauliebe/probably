    "title": "Peasants of Roumania war costumes resembling ancient Roman garb. Throughout Roumania the peasant men wear a costume that is a relic of the old Roman days. During the Roman occupation of this section of Europe, when the country was known as Dacia, the people of the region gained their first knowledge of Latin and also picked up a number of Roman customs. The skirt-like garb of the Roumanian peasant men today is a relic of the ancient Roman tunic. The trousers they wear are made of heavy white unbleached wool. In a long days journey through Roumania, you will probably never see one of these costumes that is not spotless white. In the winter time a heavily padded vest, usually beautifully embroidered, is worn in preference to the European style coat. It is in such populations as these thrifty Roumanian villagers that the American Red Cross, with its commission to Roumania, has made many new friends during the past winter by distibuting drugs and clothing to the needy"
