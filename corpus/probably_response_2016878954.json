    "title": "\"How about the appropriations?\" Mino, the talking mino bird from East India, has become interested in legislative affairs since he came to Washington. While talking, whistling, or making bugle calls he suddenly astounds his audience by asking, \"How about the appropriations, how about the appropriations?\" He probably attended a session of the Senate to hear this. The unusual bird is shown with the proprieter of the Washington bird store who is his present owner. 11/13/30"
