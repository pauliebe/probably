Her father and mother are dead. Her home is in ashes. Her brothers and sister are scattered, probably dead. Serbia has 300,000 such parentless children and each one of these seems to carry on their little shoulders the full burden of Serbia's sorrow. A place has just been found for this little girl in the American Red Cross orphanage at Vrange, where she will learn to smile again"
