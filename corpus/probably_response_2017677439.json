This is the title that has been frequently applied to Queen Marie of Roumania, not only because of her renowned beauty but because of her charming manner and democracy. There is probably no ruler in Europe who has the welfare of the people so much at heart as Wueen [sic] Marie. This picture shows her on her way to visit the American Red Cross orphanage in Bucarest. The Queen is a weekly visitor at the institution and the children are always rewarded with candy, toys or cakes when the Queen visits them"
