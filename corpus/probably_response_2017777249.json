    "title": "Consolidated Coal Company, Lake Creek Mine, Johnston City, Illinois. Abandoned. This mine will never work again. Williamson County, Illinois once produced 11,000,000 tons of coal a year and led the state in output. Since 1923, output has steadily declined until now it falls short of 2,000,000 tons. At one time sixteen mine whistles blowing to work could be hard from the center of Herrin. Now only two mines are working and these two will probably be abandoned within the next year"
