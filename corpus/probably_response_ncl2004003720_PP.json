    "title": "Mrs. Gay, 33 James Street, Attleboro, Mass., and children - 5, 7, 12, and 13 years old, setting stones in cheap jewelry. There were 244 stones in this lot. She said they earned about $5 a week when all worked steadily. (One boy of 10 works, not there when photo was taken.) They work every day except Saturday (house work day) and probably not much Sunday. Work after school and evenings until 8 P.M. or after. The children were home with sore throat, but working industriously. Father works in factory. Photo at 4 P.M.  Location: Attleboro, Massachusetts."
