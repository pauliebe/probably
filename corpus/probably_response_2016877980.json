    "title": "Former White House officer in new role. Washington, D.C., Sept. 9. For 36 years Lieut. Ernest M. \"Larry\" Seaman stood day after day at the door of the White House Executive offices and welcomed presidential callers. During this time \"Larry\" probably met more famous people than any other person in the world. But this past history for Seaman now as he retired a short time ago and accepted a post at a local bank in charge of safety deposit vaults. Prior to coming to the White House during the Roosevelt Administration he was for four years a member of the Metropolitan Police Force. Seaman is shown opening one of the boxes for Miss Katheryn Fout, 9/9/37"
