    "title": "Fruit farmer and his wife, Placer County, California. He owns four hundred acres and has farmed this land for about thirty-five years. He started work in this section freighting ore out. Next he went into cattle raising and about twenty-five years ago into fruit. Last good year for him was ten years ago, but now there is no market for the variety of pears and plums he grows. He has a large loan from Federal Land Bank, he will probably not be able to pay out and will lose his farm"
