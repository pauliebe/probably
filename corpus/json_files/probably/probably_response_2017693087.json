    "title": "German warning to occupied France. Here, in the Nazis' own black and white, is visual testimony to the fact that the battle of France continues. This grim poster came to the Office of War Information (OWI) from Paris by a devious route, a route which for obvious reasons cannot be given but which, by its very existence, proves that the Gestapo isn't all-powerful. Bordered in red, surmounted by  eagle and swastika, the poster is a notice that a member of the German army was killed in Paris, August 21, 1941, and that, as a consequence, every Frenchman under arrest, from August 23 on, will be considered a hostage. \"In the case of another attack,\" the notice--in French and German--states, \"hostages in a number corresponding to the seriousness of the criminal act committed will be shot.\" Here is the full text of the warning which the angry Nazis--probably frightened, too - plastered on the walls of occupied France"
