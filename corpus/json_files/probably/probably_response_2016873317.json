    "title": "Chief Executive discusses rail problems with R.R. Heads. Washington, D.C., April 4. Following a conference [..] President Roosevelt today, representatives of rail [...] and management indicated the chief executive would probably send a special message on railroad problems to congress sometime this week. From a reliable source, it was learned the president asked the railroads not to out the wages of their nearly 1,000,000 employees. At the same time the railroad men laid before the President Roosevelt a proposal for a federal guarantee of rail income as an effort to revive business and save the industry. In the photograph, left to right: (front row) George Harrison, Chairman of Railroad Labor Association of American Railroads; E.J. Manion, President of Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen. Back row, left to right: Ernest E. Norris, Vice President of Southern Railway; and S.H. Hogan, President of Marine Engineers, 4/4/38"
