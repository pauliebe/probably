    "title": "The mill school of the Anniston Mfg. Co. These are boys at the mill school who have to make the 8 weeks schooling for the year. The school is miserably equipped. Willie Laty, the shortest boy, said he was 10 years old, and been working there about 1 year. He and the other boy said he had a job as a spinner and sweeper, but that he had just been fired (probably after the boss saw the investigator photograph them.) Collie Webb and Archie Croll are also probably under 12, and some girls not in this photograph.  Location: Anniston, Alabama."
