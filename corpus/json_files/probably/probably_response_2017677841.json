    "title": "Poland's tribute to America. The old Schloss Tower, there is probably no more famous tower in Eastern Europe than that of the old Schloss, or palace in Cracow, the city which was once the capital of Poland. The tower is on the cathedral enclosed within the palace walls and beside it stands the newer and leftier, but less historic one. Beneath it lie the tombs of all the Polish kings who struggled to maintain the integrity of the country, many having given their lives on the battlefield for their country's cause. Cracow, the capital and the historic tombs of kings passed into Austrian hands with the partition of Poland and has only been rejoined to the mother country since 1918. The cathedral is veritably the shrine of Poland"
