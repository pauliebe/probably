    "title": "Freezing of Japan's credits may popularize cotton stockings for milady. Washington, D.C., July 26. It appears that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's efforts to improve cotton stockings and thereby popularize the wearing of them as a means of disposing of surplus long-staple cotton, will bear fruit now that Japan's assets have been frozen in the U.S. Japan furnishes most of the silk used in the stockings manufactured in this country and at the present time, according to reports, there is only about two and a half month's supply left. Trade between the U.S. and Japan no doubt will be hard hit because of the difficulty of making payments. Nylon production is also slow so the ladies will probably be wearing cotton stockings by the end of the year or else go barelegged. In this picture, David H. Young, Agriculture Department fabric technician, is shown examining one of the cotton stockings which they are trying to popularize"
