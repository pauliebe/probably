    "title": "Georges Jahouel is the son of a French Bracardier (stretcher bearer) who volunteered to go out into \"No Man's Land\" to bring in the wounded under especially heavy fire. His Captain told him to save himself but he went out anyway and lost his life. Now Georges must be the little father of the family and his mother says he helps her almost as if he were a man. He goes to school and studies hard so that he may soon be able to write a letter without any mistakes in it to his \"good god fathers\", the Enlisted Ordance Detachment, Georges probably cannot yet write his parrains' (sp?) name and address without being prompted but he loves them dearly nevertheless and sends them \"much kisses\". The A.R.C. administers the funds for the maintenance of all the children adopted by the American troops"
