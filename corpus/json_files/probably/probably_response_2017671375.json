In this Balkan country, which is probably the least toouched by modern inventions of any nation in Europe, the women learned to sew on a machine for the first time in the workrooms established by the Red Cross. Sewing schools were set up in various parts of the country and women made the unfinished cloth sent from American into thousands of garments for the poor and destitute of their country. The workers, who were themselves in straightened circumstances, were paid in supplies, for which they were most grateful"
