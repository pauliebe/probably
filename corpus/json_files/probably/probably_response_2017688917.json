    "title": "Abandoned one-room schoolhouse in a mostly abandoned town: Aroya, in Cheyenne County, Colorado. The name \"Arroyo\", the Spanish word for \"gulch,\" appears on some older maps. Aroya, probably a corruption of the Spanish, originated in 1870 three miles west of the present site as a camp for Kansas-Pacific Railroad track-layers, but was moved to the present site because there was a better supply of water. The schoolhouse was in use until the early 1960s"
