    "title": "48.  Interior detail, study, double-hung sash in the south wall. Most of the windows in the John Bartram House were replaced sometime in the first decades of the nineteenth century. This window contains a slightly wider muntin profile than the later sash and is probably representative of the windows used in phase III construction (Mid-1750's-1770). - John Bartram House & Garden, House, 54th Street & Lindbergh Boulevard, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA"
