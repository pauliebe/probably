    "title": "Georges Jahouel is the son of a French Brancardier (stretcher bearer) who volunteered to go out into \"No Man's Land\" to bring in the wounded under especially heavy fire. His captain told him to save himself but he went out anyway and lost his life. Now Georges must be the little father of the family and his mother saus he helps her almost as if he were a man. He goes to school and studies hard that he may soon be able to write a letter without any mistakes in it to his \"good godfathers\", the Enlisted Ordinance Detachment [...] Georges probably cannot yet write his parrains' name and address without being prompted, but he loves them dearly, nevertheless, and sends them \"much kisses\". The American Red Cross administers the funds for the maintenance of all the children adopted by the American troops"
