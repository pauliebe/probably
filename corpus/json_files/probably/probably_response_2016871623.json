    "title": "Harlan witness tells of bribe to hide-out. Washington, D.C., April 28. Hugh Taylor, former Harlan County, Ky. Deputy Sheriff, told the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee today that High Sheriff T.R. Middleton offered him $2,000 to hide out during the present investigation. With both hands crippled by bullet wounds, Taylor declared he spent two weeks in emergency hospital here in March after being forced to flee Harlan hospital. He was shot, he said, by two other deputies, probably because he refused to join in the Musick murder, 4/28/1937"
