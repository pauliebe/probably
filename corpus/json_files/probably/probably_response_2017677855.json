Warsaw's Russian church, in their desire to eliminate everything Russian, Poles, since the war, at first planned to tear down the magnificient cathedral of Alexander Nevski, a great edifice erected during the Russian domination in the hope that the religion of the Poles could be changed. After tearing the dome from the bell tower, however, the policy of the government was changed and the beautiful piece of architecture will now remain and probably will become a national museum. In this cathedral on July 4 was held the service at which blessings were invoked upon the Americans who have helped Poland by relief work during the past two years during which the country has been struggling to establish itself as a nation"
