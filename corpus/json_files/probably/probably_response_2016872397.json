Gazley, New Chief of the Safety and Planning Division of the Bureau of Air Commerce, U.S. Department of Commerce. All problems relating to aircraft, airports, air transport, education, international relations, power plants, and radio development come under his direct supervision. One of the most important phases of his job is the developing and testing of all new safety devices for aircraft. In this picture, Gazley is shown inspecting an audio meter for testing radio receiving apparatus."
