    "title": "3:30 P.M. Picking nuts in dirty basement. The dirtiest imaginable children were pawing over the nuts, eating lunch on the table, etc. Mother had a cold, blew her nose frequently (without washing hands) and the dirty handkerchief reposed comfortably on the table and close to the nuts and nut meats. The father picks now. \"No work to do at any business.\" (Has a cobbler's shop in the room.) They said the children didn't pick near. (Probably a temporary respite.) See 2685.  Location: [New York, New York (State)]."
