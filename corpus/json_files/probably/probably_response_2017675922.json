    "title": "A model farm according to the latest American ideas of intensive agriculture, is being established by the American Red Cross on the grounds surrounding the American hospital at Sarisbury, near Southampton. The Red Cross farm is in charge of Capt. Frank S. Peer, of Ithaca, N.Y. is a well-known international farmer and cattle breeder, who proposes to teach the convalescent American soldiers all they want to learn about modern farming. The photograph shows Mr. Peer's ideas of intensive farming as exemplified on his own farm on the little island of Guernsey, in the English channel. Here he is putting into effect all that he learned in many years of farming in Wayne County, N.Y. and at Cranford, N.J. of the little patch of ground shown in the photograph, Mr. Peer writes: \"We have just completed a week's feeding for ten head of full-grown cattle on seven square rods of oats and peas. The land was formerly a vegatable garden. The oats stand over five feet high, the land would probably grow at the rate of 5 tons of hay to the acre"
