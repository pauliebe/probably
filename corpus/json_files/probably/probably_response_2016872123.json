Led by Senator Ellison D. \"Cotton Ed\" Smith, of South Carolina, a delegation of congressmen from the cotton states called on President Roosevelt today and presented their demands for enactment of a farm program before congressional adjournment. After the conference a spokesman for the group told reporters he felt the president would make stabilization loans under existing discretionary powers, probably through the Commodity Credit Corporation, on all basic commodities if given \"definite assurances\" that a farm production control program would be enacted early next session. In the picture, left to right: Rep. William R. Poage, Texas; Rep. John J. Sparkman, Ala.; Senator Ellison D. Smith, S.C.; Rep. Rene L. De Rouen, LA.; Rep. Lyndon Johnson, Tex.; Rep. Aaron Lane Ford, Miss. and Rep. Clyde Garrett, Texas, 8/5/37"
