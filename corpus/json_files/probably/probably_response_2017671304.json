They have brought a new idea to this old world country, probably the most primitive in Europe. Wherever those flags are exhibited, the people know they can look for a lightening of their burdens and a helping hand with their troubles. This shows the American Red Cross hospital at Tirana, to which American doctors and nurses go into the surrounding country to care for the sick and ailing. At the extreme right is Dr. Lloyd W. Brooke of Portland, Oreg. Director of the Tirana Hospital"
