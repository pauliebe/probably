    "title": "AMA descends upon Wagner hearing today. Washington, D.C., May 25. Probably the most impressive group of physicians ever to appear before a Senate body today occupied the hearings of the Senate Committee holding hearings on the Wagner Health Bill. Armed with statistics and lengthy statements, a group of American Medical Association officers argued against passage of Senator Wagner's $850,000,000 national health program bill. Dr. R.G. Leland, Director of the Bureau of Medical Economics of the AMA, called the bill 'revolutionary' and suggested that public health is rapidly improving without the aid of such a program, as shown by official vital statistics. Left to right. Dr. Edward H. Cary, Chairman of the Legislative Committee, AMA, who introduced the speakers to the committee, and Dr. Leland"
