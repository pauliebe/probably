Under the terms the CIO offered to return to the American Federation of Labor as an independent, a situation that which would probably result in the CIO becoming the dominant wing of the American Labor Movement. Left to right: Charles Howard, President of the International Typographical Union and Secretary of the CIO; Philip Murray, Chairman of the CIO Delegation [...] meeting; and Joseph Curran, President of the National Maritime Union. 10/26/37"
