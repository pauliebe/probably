This former swimming pool of the Penn Athletic Club in Philadelphia now houses part of the offices of the Securities and Exchange Commission which were formerly in Washington. The pool was boarded over on top and desks and filing cabinets installed ... SEC is one of at least ten, and maybe more, Federal agencies which are being moved from Washington to other large cities to make room for war workers. More than 12,000 employes [sic] and their families are involved in the biggest mass moving job of all time."
