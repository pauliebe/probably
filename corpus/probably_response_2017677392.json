This group was among the best dressed to be found in Podgoritza so the others may be pictured accordingly. Every day miserably clad urchins pour into the Junior Red Cross of America orphanage and distribution stations and receive clothing that has the stamp of some American school boy or girl on it. Some of it has been worn before but most of it is new in many cases made by the donors. Always it fills a need desperate beyond the imagination of the well-dressed and comfortably shed American child"
